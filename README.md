# AutoViewHub

TradingView strategies dont provide a mechanism to replicate the results in AutoView. Using thirdparty tools we seek to remove this boundry of entry to new traders, mostly through template inherance to create modules.

Additionally all contributers will be rewarded from donations for their strategies in accordance with the gains relative to the rest of the library. Hoping to create an Etherium smart contract when I get the time. :smiley:
